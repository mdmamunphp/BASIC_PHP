Resume, LinkedIn Profile, & Bio Writer l HR Management and Consulting
I am a senior level HR Consultant and a career coach, resume/LinkedIn profile writer, author, and Huffington Post career advice blogger based near Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

I have worked in the Human Resources Management field, for over 15 years, with my last position being the Director of Human Resources for an innovative renewable solutions company. I am not just a great writer; I have reviewed tens of thousands of resumes throughout my career, while working in a hiring capacity, and have hired (and not hired!) thousands of individuals. Without a doubt, I know *exactly* what it takes to get you noticed.

I also had the rewarding opportunity to create a Human Resources department from scratch as we tripled the size of the company. I wrote the first policy and procedure manual and its many subsequent revisions. I was also responsible for the corporate employee newsletter, new hire collateral, most corporate communication pieces, and all recruiting.

Most recently, I have been working as an HR Consultant for small businesses all over the country helping them create HR processes and procedures. I also work as a career coach/resume writer and have written/re-written hundreds of resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and bios. In addition, I help job seekers prepare for job interviews by running them through an actual job interview and providing comprehensive feedback. My extensive HR/business background, combined with my exceptional writing skills, gives me a strong edge in any project involving HR Consulting/Management, recruiting, resume/cover letter/LinkedIn profile writing, and job/career coaching.

I have my first book launching later this year...stay tuned!

Best,
Jessica Simko
