About us: We are an automotive technology startup looking to create a real-time vehicle pricing engine to predict a vehicles wholesale value based on the entries of its Year, Make, Model, Trim, Engine Size, and Mileage.  

Basically, a customer will enter their vehicle parameters on our website and ping our database to return a value.

We need someone well-versed (preferably in automotive preferred) in creating a linear/multi-regression model from a large data set which we can provide.  Basically, we know how it should work and the initial blueprint, but need the "brain" to establish the model.

Who we are looking for -

- Experience with these models, preferably automotive.
- Looking for someone that can TEACH US what we dont know and how it can be done in a clear manner.
- Experience with R or similar platforms
- Experience with databases and SQL.Aurora.  Might need this person for uploading and tweaks to the model.  Possibly a partner.

******IMPORTANT: Other than the questions on the posting, can you provide a ROUGH estimate (just for better understanding) of:

- Approx. time to complete
- Cost
