Fashion Design

Looking for a super creative modern fashion designer to create contemporary vintage inspired jackets.

I am looking for someone who can help me do the following:

- Work together on the creative part of the design process
- Design flat sketches to illustrate the final creation we previously agreed on
- Discuss the sizing
- Illustrate the sketches by including the followings: description of the garment, embellishments, measurements, material, special cuts...

The blazers I want to design would be inspired by vintage pieces from classic designers with contemporary cuts and materials.

We can include in the flat sketches : epaulettes, large squared shoulders,  oversized shapes, big belts, special cuts etc...

More details will be shared once shortlisted.

Thanks
